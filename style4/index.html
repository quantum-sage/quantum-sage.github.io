				<li>Classical mechanics is a physical theory describing the motion of macroscopic objects.</li>

				<li>Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.</li>

				<li>Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy.</li>

				<li>Mathematical physics refers to the development of mathematical methods for application to problems in physics.</li>

				<li>Condensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of matter, especially the solid and liquid phases which arise from electromagnetic forces between atoms.</li>

    		<ul>

    			<li>Geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the sizes, shapes, positions angles and dimensions of things. </li>

    			<li>Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.</li>

    			<li>Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or "the calculus of infinitesimals", is the mathematical study of continuous change.</li>

    			<li>Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as: linear maps such as: and their representations in vector spaces and through matrices. Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics.</li>

    			<li>Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. </li>

    		<li> Quantum algorithm is an algorithm which runs on a realistic model of quantum computation, the most commonly used model being the quantum circuit model of computation.</li>

    		<li> Quantum error correction (QEC) is used in quantum computing to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise </li>

    		<li> Quantum cryptography is the science of exploiting quantum mechanical properties to perform cryptographic tasks.</li>

    		<li> Quantum teleportation is a technique for transferring quantum information from a sender at one location to a receiver some distance away.</li>
